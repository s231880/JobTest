//--------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW------------------------------------------------------------------
The media player allows to play/pause, stop and change songs with the buttons at the bottom of the UI,
change the visual effect with the toggles at the top, and change the effect color and the volume through the sliders. 

I've tried to complete every task.Task1 was the most difficul and I'm not sure if I've did it well,my visual effects are not so fancy and their classes
are almost equal. Task2 was easy, but I'm not sure if it is complete, or if I could have done more and better. 
The tasks 3&4 were easy, while task5 gave me some problems, and sometime changing the visual effect at runtime generate a little bug.

Future Improvements 
-> A new UI
-> Better visual effects, maybe developing diffent shaders
-> Improving the color palette
-> Fixing the bug

The assignmet wasn't difficult, but I was a little bit rusty with Unity so I had to do some attempts to become familiar with the code and understand
how to implement task1. I also had some problem when improving the code because I get stucked and I loose 4/5 hours, and I had not time to finish and fix 
the bug(I worked all those days).
